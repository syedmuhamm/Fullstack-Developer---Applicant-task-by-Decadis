Task for Decadis, as a part of hiring process.

Started the task from frontend, by creating a react app and installing dependencies for typescript, sass, material ui. The plan is to make frontend first, 
use dummy data in frontend for populution, and then make a backend later and connect it to the existing frontend components.

Made components, pages and services folder and made respective files for each folder. 

Made pages for each view, i.e viewing a user, creating a user, updating a user, but then noticed that the Mockup has been set up as a dialog.
So, I changed logic again to set up some components as a dialog, and main view i.e. viewing all users as a route to localhost/3000. 

I have decided to leave the orignal code for separate pages for each view, in the first commit. 

There were changes made during execution regarding code optimization, and there are possible places at this point to add more code optimization, clarification ( comments etc).
